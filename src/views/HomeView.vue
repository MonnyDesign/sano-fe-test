   <p class="mb-6 text-center text-sm font-bold">‚ö† Please use the readme.md file as a guide on how to submit your work.</p>

   <!-- Instructions -->
   <p class="mb-6">
      In this test, you will display a list of studies and be able to Leave/Join any study. The list of studies should look beautiful, be accessible and mobile
      friendly.
   </p>

   <p class="mb-6">Add your development magic to the existing <RouterLink to="/studies">Studies</RouterLink> page.</p>

   <p class="mb-6">
      Use the API file to add some basic endpoints using the <a href="https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter" target="_blank">axios mock adapter</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="mb-6 font-bold">Task List:</p>

   <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li class="mb-4">
         Fetch an array of studies by creating the following endpoint in the API file.
         <pre class="endpoint">GET /home-test/users/1337/studies</pre>
      </li>
      <li class="mb-4">
         Display the list of studies. Study Name, Run By (researcher) & Status of each study should be displayed in the list.
         <br />
         The Status should either say "Enrolled", "Withdrawn" or "Not Started". The status can be deduced from the joined property. If the user has joined the
         study, it means that they are enrolled.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-4">
         Each study list item should also have a 'Join/Leave' button. If the user is enrolled in the study, the button text should say 'Leave Study'. If the
         user has not started the study yet or they previously left/withdrew from the study, the button text should say "Join Study".

         <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
            <li class="mb-4">
               Clicking the 'Leave Study' button should withdraw the user from the study. <br />
               Create an endpoint in the API file which receives a DELETE request and changes the 'joined' state. Send a SUCCESS response back, the button
               should then say 'Join Study'.
               <pre class="endpoint">DELETE /home-test/users/1337/studies/&lt;study_id&gt;</pre>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
               Clicking the 'Join Study' button should add the user to study. <br />
               Create an endpoint in the API file which receives a PUT request and changes the 'joined' state. Send a SUCCESS response back, the button should
               then say 'Leave Study'.
               <pre class="endpoint">PUT /home-test/users/1337/studies/&lt;study_id&gt;</pre>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="mb-4">
         The list of studies should look nice, use the Sano colour scheme, be <em>accessible</em> and <em>mobile friendly</em>. Things we look for in
         accessibility: Is the HTML markup correct? Can we navigate the Studies page by keyboard only (tabbing)? Will screenreaders be able to navigate the
         page.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-4">
         Clicking on the consent sheet button should show a modal containing the consent text. Please build your own basic modal, don't use third party modals.
         Use Pinia to store the modal state.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-4">Setup a simple Cypress test which will test the functionality above.</li>
   </ol>

   <p class="mt-10 mb-6">We hope you have fun doing the test üòÅ. Use the readme.md guide on how to submit your work and the Loom video.</p>
